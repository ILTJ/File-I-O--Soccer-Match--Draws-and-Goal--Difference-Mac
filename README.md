File-I-O--Soccer-Match--Draws-and-Goal-Difference-
==================================================

This is a basic C++ program on Mac that uses file input (input1.txt) and output (output2.txt). 
This program gets the data from the input file and outputs the numbers of draws and the maximum goal 
and the respective matches.

Thanks to Liew Zhao Wei (http://github.com/zwliew) for helping with a bit of the code.

Sample Input:
<Number of Matches>Eg. 10
<Score seperated by a spacing>Eg. 3 0
<Score 2 on the next line>

sampleinput.txt for example of input!
